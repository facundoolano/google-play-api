The gameplay loop is shallow to the point where it's almost non existent, you hit a button it rolls you move and get the arbitrary rewards on that tile, there's no property buying or advancement, no other players on your board playing with you. This is monopoly in name only, no resemblance to the original game other than the characters. Oh and when you run out of rolls be ready for 3 pop ups prompting you to buy more with real money.","N/A","N/A",,0

The game keeps crashes and says error required to restart then just keeps going and going. I really don't want to uninstall this game 'cause it's really fun and addictive, but it's kinda annoying. Idk if the wifi's the problem or it's the game itself... But I'll probably install this again if they fix this problem, thank you :)","N/A","N/A","0.7.0",7
