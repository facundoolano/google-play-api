    "summary": "The Expedition is a GPU benchmark for mobile devices, premium smartphones being as target devices. It offers a very demanding workload for that device range. <br>GPUScore: The Expedition measures GPU performance in a 3D mobile game scenario. It could be an action or real-time strategy game that the content represents, with a logical story line. This approach was chosen as being more representative for real games, having a logical flow from the start to the finish. <br>All GPUScore benchmarks do their benchmark runs frame based, which guarantees maximally comparable results, as the workload is made as identical as possible on all tested devices. GPUScore benchmarks also avoid hitting frame rate limits of devices by rendering 9 frames per displayed frame. Driver trickery like skipping non-rendered frames is tackled by showing clearly visible thumbnails of the frames in between in a grid strip at the bottom of the screen. Too small thumbnails could invite driver trickery.<br>The Expedition includes several different benchmark tests, or modes, which utilize the same content but different settings:<br>Official: <br>This is the primary benchmark that produces the most comparable results. This mode also submits the results of the benchmark run to Basemark’s online results platform, Powerboard 4.0. The benchmark content is always rendered at 2540x1440 resolution ‘under the hood’, even though the device’s display resolution may be different. This mode produces the most comparable measurement of the device’s GPU’s rendering performance. <br>Official Native:<br>This mode renders the content at the native resolution of the device’s display. This test offers an insight into the practical performance of the device, as applications, and sometimes even games, render at native resolution. Performance result comparisons in this mode might reveal how devices of an older generation may render the content faster than newer or higher end devices, because the higher end devices often have much higher display resolution. This test also uploads the results to Basemark’s Powerboard 4.0, but into a separate category than the Official benchmark.<br>Official VRS:<br>The Official VRS test mode renders the benchmark content at 2560x1440 resolution with same settings as the Official, but with Variable Rate Shading enabled. The results are uploaded to a separate Official VRS category on Powerboard 4.0. This mode is only available on devices with VRS hardware and driver support. <br>Custom:<br>The custom benchmark enables GPU performance benchmarking beyond the Official benchmarks above. In case you want to compare devices’ performance using another common resolution than the one used in the Official benchmark ,or you want to use lighter rendering settings for benchmarking lower end devices, this mode allows it. Lower end devices can also be benchmarked using the older benchmark, Basemark GPU, which is also available for mobile operating systems. Custom mode allows users to modify the parameters for benchmark runs. The default values, which are also the values used in the Official benchmark, are written in bold. These options are available in all versions of GPUScore: The Expedition.<br>Experience:<br>Experience mode runs the benchmark scene in time-based rendering mode. No benchmark results are produced in Experience mode as different frames may be rendered on each device, potentially even when rerunning on the same device.",

The IQ ranking is made from a relative point of view. In other words, some variables are used and then an intelligence test is made. This intelligence test is made in a way that measures the IQ of a person in those areas. It is very difficult to make an IQ test that truly takes a person&#39;s absolute true intelligence. However, by taking a common statistic (for example language, or counting), we can make an IQ test that measures people&#39;s intelligence. Scientists approach IQ measuring tests in a similar way. By taking common variables as the core statistic, a general IQ test can be made that measures the IQ of a huge portion of the population. <br><br>More important information regarding the calculation of IQ score &gt;&gt; IQ scores are highly relative when it comes to measurement. Imagine a system in which grading and measurement is done based on some variables. These variables are constructed by some experts based on certain assumptions. These assumptions lie at the core of calculation of IQ. So, people whose lives are not surrounded by the implications of these assumptions will be worse off when it comes to the test. In other words, you cannot calculate the IQ of an elephant in the same way you would with a kangaroo. Therefore, IQ scores are highly relative and up to a great amount of discussion. With this in mind, we have put multiple IQ tests in one test so that people can choose which type of IQ score they would like to test themselves in. <br><br>Important Note: IQ Test - Intelligence Test is aimed to be fun, entertaining, and educating. Under no circumstances the user should think that this is absolutely representative of his true intelligence and character. Enjoy it!",

    "summary": "<b>What Is Emotional Intelligence? EQ IQ</b><br>Emotional intelligence refers to the ability to identify and manage one’s own emotions, as well as the emotions of others.<br><br>Emotional intelligence is generally said to include at least three skills: emotional awareness, or the ability to identify and name one’s own emotions; the ability to harness those emotions and apply them to tasks like thinking and problem solving; and the ability to manage emotions, which includes both regulating one’s own emotions when necessary and helping others to do the same.<br><br>There is no validated psychometric test or scale for emotional intelligence as there is for &quot;g,&quot; the general intelligence factor—and many argue that emotional intelligence is therefore not an actual construct, but a way of describing interpersonal skills that go by other names. <br><br>Despite this criticism, emotional intelligence (“emotional quotient,”  or &quot;EQ&quot; as it’s sometimes known) has wide appeal among the general public, as well as in certain sectors. In recent years, some employers have even incorporated emotional intelligence tests into their application or interview processes, on the theory that someone high in emotional intelligence would make a better leader or coworker.<br><br>While some studies have found a link between emotional intelligence and job performance, others have shown no correlation, and the lack of a scientifically-valid scale makes it difficult to truly measure or predict someone’s emotional intelligence on the job.<br><br><b>Signs of &quot;High EQ”</b> An emotionally intelligent individual is both highly conscious of his or her own emotional states, even negativity—frustration, sadness, or something more subtle—and able to identify and manage them.  <br><br>These people are also especially tuned in to the emotions others experience. It’s easy to see how a sensitivity to emotional signals from within and from the social environment could make one a better friend, parent, leader, or romantic partner. Fortunately, these skills can be honed.<br><br>How can you identify High EQ: <br><br>✅ primal leadership<br>✅ emotional iq<br>✅ high eq<br>✅ working with emotional intelligence<br><br><br>Main features of Emotional Intelligence app: <br><br>💗 emotional intelligence<br>💗 emotional intelligence 2.0<br>💗 emotional quotient",

Incorrect problems are listed at the end of each session and you&#39;ll have the option to repeat all the questions, repeat only on the incorrect attempts, or shuffle the questions all together.<br><br><b>Time Trials</b> is where you put all that practice to the test: How fast can you answer 12 multiplication questions? Compete against yourself or compare your times with friends and people all over the world with this multiplication game! <br><br><b>Time Records</b> keeps track of your top 10 fastest completion times for each multiplication problem set attempted in the Time Trials area. Displays your rank, initials, time, and date for each record. Note: to set a record, you must answer 10 of the 12 questions correctly!<br><br><b>Data</b> is where you can see how you&#39;re doing for each multiplication fact. The result for each fact is displayed as a colored box inside a multiplication chart. The colors range from green to red (with green meaning good and red meaning not-so-good). Pressing a box will show more details for that fact: Number Correct, Total Attempts, Percentage, and Grade.<br><br>Look for more multiplication games and features to be added in the future!<br><br>This is a free-to-download, ad-supported app.<br><br>Thanks for recommending and leaving a review.<br><br><br><b>MATH Domain Development</b>",

Rules, both written and unwritten, can make contact between people difficult. These unspoken guidelines may cause discomfort for those around you. Some persons may not naturally acquire the skills essential for effective social skills through socialization, despite the fact that most people do. However, they should not give up because social skills can also be improved with purposeful effort, particularly when you are equipped with pertinent knowledge about which areas require improvement.",

Clinical depression generally responds positively to treatment, so it is important to seek treatment if you are concerned about your mental health. <br><br>New Feature: Keep your results private with a passcode lock! <br><br>DISCLAIMER: This self-test is not meant to be a diagnosis for your depression.
